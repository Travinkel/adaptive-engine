Feature: Dynamic ZPD Flow-Channel Maintenance
  As an Adaptive Orchestrator
  I want to adjust the "Scaffold Density" based on real-time NCDE friction
  So that the learner remains in a state of "Flow" without cognitive collapse.

  @Positive @Flow-State @Scaffolding
  Scenario: Real-Time Scaffold Injection
    Given the learner's "NCDE Friction" vector exceeds the 2.5 threshold
    When the system detects a "Logic Deadlock" in the Left Pane
    Then the CLI should "Inject" a temporary scaffold into the Right Pane
    And the scaffold should be a "Faded-Parsons" version of the prerequisite node
    And once the friction vector drops, the scaffold should be "Vaporized" immediately.
